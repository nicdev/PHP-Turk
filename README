PHPTurk is a library to facilitate the use of the Amazon Mechanical Turk 
web service in PHP. The library itself is a wrapper for the REST API.

For a list of operations available through the REST API see 
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSMturkAPI/2008-08-02/
The initial release has a very limited feature set, but provides the 
structure for creating functions for every operation offered by Amazon. 

If you'd like to contribute by improving the code, or creating functions 
for missing operations, please do so through GitHub.
